# Vision and Key Changes

    * __Vision__
      * Our goal is to create a world class global finance function that provides consistent high quality service to business managers and our client account teams\, lowers enterprise risk and cost\, supports improved integration of the organization globally and invests in development and career path for our people\.

__b\)__  __One__  __Global Reporting System__

__c\) Standardized__  __Reports__

__and__  __Delivery__

__a\) Accounting__  __Policies__

Policies will improve the comparability between our financial statements and drivestandardization\.

Policies will harmonize the overall layout of reports \(e\.g\. revised P&L structured\) and the definitions of our KPIs

Reduces local flexibility and individuality

Individual hierarchies and aggregations of code blocks reduced to one Management hierarchy  managed by eachSub\-Area

Common and consistent KPI definition

Changes and enhancements are managed by a governance process owned by Global Finance

Reports have a consistent layout as well as look\-and\-feel

Reports look different than currently and might have a different layout \(e\.g\. order to columns\)

Reports are mainly accessed via the new Reporting Portal \(self\-service\) through the intranet and not sent out via email \(some exceptions  – report books\)

<span style="color:#080808">Globally consisten</span> t\, standardized and comparable information based on a consistent set of KPIs/metrics\, calculations and structures

<span style="color:#080808">A consistent tool set that supports mobility of people and</span> quick <span style="color:#080808">information</span>  <span style="color:#080808">availability</span>

# Standard Reporting vs. Ad hoc Analysis

_In addition to standard reports available in the reporting portal\, a subset of users will be able to conduct ad hoc analysis using Excel_

__Standard Reporting__

Access via the Reporting portal through the Intranet

Standardized and consistent report templates

Limited access to reports\, data and functionality

Functionality of reports differ for Finance and Business Management users

Standard delivery methodology:pull

For Business Management certain reports will be pushed

* __Ad Hoc__  __Analysis__
* Access through Microsoft Excel only for a limited number of Finance people
* Free\-formanalysis \- notemplates available but limited to the existing data models
* Use of Excel’s analysis functionality:
  * Standard functionality like sorting\, grouping\, calculations
  * Graphical functionality
  * Pivoting functionality
* Deliverymethodology to other audiences: individual push \(no automation\)

# C. Weekly and Monthly Data UpdatesData and Calculations (1/2)

FTE calculations: weekly vs\. monthly data/cube

  * Weekly cube gets updated on a weekly basis
  * On the weekly cube you can select week 4 and look at the MTD number which are calculated as \(week 1 \+ week 2 \+ week 3 \+ week 4\) / 4

  * Monthly cube only on a monthly basis \(with daily updates on the closing week\)
  * Whereas the monthly cube doesn't have the week option available and therefore always calculates as \(week 1 \+ week 2 \+ week 3 \+ week 4 \+ week 5\) / 5 disregarding if any of those weeks are not available or not
  * So until we get the week 5 update the monthly cube will show the wrong FTE numbers as they are incomplete
  * Due to the daily updates during the last week of the month the Op Statement data is not complete and is not reasonable in many lines

__Keep in mind:__

Daily updates are made at month end to better support the close process and to ensure journal entries are posted correctly

At certain times different data/results will appear if comparing the weekly and monthly data\. This is driven by the fact that the cubes are updated at different times\.

__Example:__

Example 2nd day of week 5 \(Tuesday\):Weekly cube only has the data until Friday last week \(week 4\)

Whereas the monthly cube already shows the data as of the day before \(Monday of week 5\)\.

Illustration

__Illustration:__

We are in the last week of a five week month

Daily updates are being  processed during week five in the monthly cubes

Since the month is not complete the FTEs in the example will be calculated as:

\(W1\+W2\+W3\+W4\+W5\) / 528\,909/5 = 5\,782

# Benefits of Pivot Tables

There are three main reasons to organize data into Pivot Tables

To summarize data from a lengthy list into a compact format

To find relationships within the data that are otherwise hard to see because of the amount of detail

To organize the data so that it is easy to chart

# Converting Pivot Tables to Formulas

Converting a pivot table to formulas allows the user to access and refresh the same data that exists in the cube

__Benefits__

Converts a pivot table to worksheet formulas in order to utilize all Excel functionality

Provides additional flexibility to customize table layouts to conduct analysis \(e\.g\. add columns/rows\)

Simplifies process of creating\, updating\, and maintaining regular analysis

Data in pivot tables converted to formulas can be refreshed

The user can reference multiple cubes on the same excel worksheet

__Negatives__

Removes ability to expand/collapse rows and columns \(drill down\)

Can continue to refresh data\, but only manually add/update elements in rows or columns


</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Convert Data to Formulas

To build and design ad hoc reports\, users can format and customize reports by selecting dimensions

If a user wants to send a worksheet with cube formulas to someone that does not have access to the cube then the user must copy the worksheet and paste values to a separate excel worksheet\.

* __Step 1:__ Create pivot table resembling desired layout
* __Step 2:__ Copy pivot table to new tab within Excel worksheet\*
* __Step 3:__ Select PivotTable Tools
* __Step 4:__ Convert pivot table to OLAP formulas
* __Step 5:__ Determine method to convert  filters
  * Convert entire PivotTable and Report Filters
  * Convert PivotTable excluding Report Filters

<img src="img/EY GFT Financial Reporting Training164.png" width=500px />

<img src="img/EY GFT Financial Reporting Training165.png" width=204px />

\*This is a recommended best practice\, but is not a mandatory step in the process\.


</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Step 1: Create Pivot Table Resembling Desired Layout

Create pivot table that most closely reflects the desired final layout with appropriate filtering\, sorting\, and expanding/collapsing

‘Select All’ needs to be checked in the Row Labels drop down in order to convert to cube formulas\.

<img src="img/EY GFT Financial Reporting Training166.png" width=500px />

It is best practice to only have one dimension in the columns and any additional dimensions in filters\. This will allow column headings to be easily referenced in the cube formulas\.

It is important to avoid overcomplicating column headings\.

<img src="img/EY GFT Financial Reporting Training167.png" width=228px />


</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Step 2: Copy Pivot Table to New Tab

Copy pivot table tab onto another tab within the worksheet so that you can always refer to the original pivot table before converting to formulas

Select ‘Create a copy’ to copy the pivot table worksheet and select its placement within the Excel workbook\.  Click ‘OK’ to initiate the copy\.

<img src="img/EY GFT Financial Reporting Training168.png" width=500px />

<img src="img/EY GFT Financial Reporting Training169.png" width=500px />

# Step 5: Convert Report Filters

The user has the option to incorporate Report Filters into the Excel worksheet before formulas are converted

If the ‘Convert Report Filters’ check box is unchecked then the pivot table will be converted to formulas excluding Report Filters

If the ‘Convert Report Filters’ check box is checked then the pivot table will be converted to formulas including Report Filters

# Situations to Convert Pivot Tables to Formulas

There are multiple situations in which it is advantageous to convert pivot table to formulas

It is appropriate to convert pivot table to formulas when the user wants to:

  * __Rearrange and delete rows\, columns or cells__

  * __Insert rows and columns__

  * __Add a Total row and column__

  * __Format rows and columns__

  * __Use absolute cell references__


</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# A. Rearrange and Delete Cells

Customize analysis by moving\, arranging\, and deleting cells and format the cells and worksheet to satisfy user preferences

The ‘2011 Total’ column still re\-flects the original sum and did not refresh

<img src="img/EY GFT Financial Reporting Training177.png" width=500px />

The user can highlight rows or columns and delete the selected fields in order to rearrange the  layout of the worksheet\.

To format the cell values\, right click on an individual cell or a group of highlighted cells and select ‘Format Cells\.\.’  On the ‘Number’ tab\, the user can customize how values are displayed within the cell\.  If the user selects ‘Number’ in the ‘Category:’ section then the user can use commas to separate thousands and can also indicate a negative number by displaying it in red font enclosed in parentheses\.

# E. Absolute Cell References

Place a dollar sign ‘$’ before the column letter and/or row number in the formula to lock a column and/or row reference into the formula\.

If you want to create a set of formulas that will always refer to either one specific row: A$1\, or one specific column: $B2\, use a dollar sign in front of the letter or row number\.  This is called an absolute cell reference\.  The letter or number following the dollar sign will remain unchanged if the formula is copied\.  Dollar signs do not change the format of the cell or the value of the formula\.

__TIP__

After entering a formula or highlighting a specific cell reference\, the user can press the F4 key to toggle between relative \(references that adjust and change when copied\) and absolute cell references\.
