# Logic of Hypothesis Testing

__Claim about a population parameter__

__Sample data is collected and analysed__

__If data contradicts claim\, then claim is rejected__

Mileage of vehicles

Efficiency of a drug

Average age of employees

Average salary of Data Scientists

Amount of fat content in food

Accuracy of a test

Placement ratio of universities

Effectiveness of a training program

# Hypothesis Testing

__Hypothesis Testing__ is a statistical technique where a claim regarding a population parameter is tested by means of sample data

__Example –__ Testing the claim about average salary of women in IT field by collecting the income data for a sample set

When a hypothesis is tested\, a statistician must decide on how much  of a difference between the claim and sample mean is necessary in order to reject the null  hypothesis

Alevelof significance oralpha \( __α__ \)is chosen for thehypothesistest which indicates how improbable a sample mean must be in order to be deemed _significantly different_ from the claimed mean

Industry standard values for __α__ are 0\.05 and 0\.01 corresponding to 95% and 99% confidence levels respectively

# Z-score, t-score and P-value

__Z score__

The Z\-score is a test statistic for Z\-tests that measures the difference between an observed statistic and its hypothesized population parameter in units of standard error\.

Converting an observation to a Z\-value is called _standardization_ \. To  standardize an observation in a population\, subtract the population  mean from the observation of interest and divide the result by the  population standard deviation\. The result of these calculations is the Z\- value associated with the observation of interest

__t\-score__

The t\-score is a test statistic for t\-tests that measures the difference between an observed sample statistic and its hypothesized population parameter in units of standard error\.

A t\-test compares the observed t\-value to a critical value on the t\-distribution with \(n\-1\) degrees of freedom to determine whether the  difference between the estimated and hypothesized values of the population parameter is statistically significant

__P\-value__

P\-value is the probability of observing a data point as close to the hypothesized mean

# Hypothesis Testing – Steps for Z-test

Problem statement with details of sample size\, sample mean\, population standard deviation and claim about population mean

__Problem Statement__

Null Hypothesis\, __H__  __0__ = Population mean claimed in problem statement

Alternate Hypothesis\, __H__  __a__ = Value of parameter contradicting the claim

__Formulation of Null and Alternate Hypotheses__

__Calculation of Test statistic__

Cut off value for the Z\-test statistic is calculated as: _NORM\.INV\(_  _α_  _\,0\,1\)_

_α_  _= probability of Type 1 Error;_

__Cut\-off value for Z\-statistic__

If abs\(Test statistic\) > abs\(Cut\-off value\)\, then reject Null Hypothesis\, __H__  __0__ ;

Else Do not reject Null Hypothesis\, __H__  __0__

# Hypothesis Testing – Case Study 1

The food label on a cookie bag states that there are at most __2__ grams of saturated fat in a single cookie\. In a sample of __35__ cookies\, it is  found that the mean amount of saturated fat per cookie is __2\.1__ grams\. Assume that the population standard deviation is __0\.25__ grams\. At __\.05__ significance level\, can we reject the claim on food label?

__Problem Statement__

Parameter of interest : Amount of saturated fat per cookie

Null Hypothesis\, __H__  __0__ :μ<= 2

Alternate Hypothesis\, __H__  __a__ :μ> 2

__Formulation of Null and Alternate Hypotheses__

__Calculation of Test statistic__

Cut off value = _NORM\.INV\(_  _α_  _\,0\,1\)_

= _NORM\.INV\(0\.05\,0\,1\)_ = __1\.645__

__Cut\-off value for Z\-statistic__

Test statistic __2\.366__ > cut\-off value __1\.645__

Hence\, at \.05 significance level\, we _reject the claim_ that there is at most  2 grams of saturated fat in a cookie

The manufacturer claims that the mean lifetime of a light bulb  is more than 10\,000 hours\. In a sample of 30 light bulbs\, it was found  that they only last 9\,900 hours on average\. Assume the sample standard  deviation is 125 hours\. At \.05 significance level\, can we reject the claim  by the manufacturer?

__Problem Statement__

Parameter of interest : Amount of saturated fat per cookie

Null Hypothesis\, __H__  __0__ :μ> 10000

Alternate Hypothesis\, __H__  __a__ :μ<= 10000

__Formulation of Null and Alternate Hypotheses__

__Calculation of Test statistic__

Cut off value = _T\.INV\(_  _α_  _\, n\-1\)_ = _T\.INV\(0\.05\, 29\)_ = __\-1\.699__

__Cut\-off value for t\-statistic__

Test statistic __4\.382__ > cut\-off value __1\.699__

Hence\, at \.05 significance level\, we _reject the claim_ that the mean lifetime of a light bulb is more than 10000 hours

The mean weight of penguins found in an Antarctic colony last year was 15\.4 kg\. In a sample of 35 penguins same time this year in  the same colony\, the mean penguin weight is 14\.6 kg\. The sample standard deviation is 2\.5 kg\. At \.05 significance level\, can we reject the claim that the mean penguin weight does not differ from last year?

__Problem Statement__

Parameter of interest : Mean weight of penguins

Null Hypothesis\, __H__  __0__ :μ= 15\.4

Alternate Hypothesis\, __H__  __a__ :μ≠15\.4

__Formulation of Null and Alternate Hypotheses__

__Calculation of Test statistic__

Cut off value = _T\.INV\(_  _α_  _/2\, n\-1\)_ = _T\.INV\(0\.05/2\, 34\)_ = __\-2\.032__

__Cut\-off value for t\-statistic__

Test statistic __1\.893__ < cut\-off value __2\.032__

Hence\, at \.05 significance level\, we _fail to reject the claim_ that the mean penguin weight does not differ from last year

__Problem Statement__

Parameter of interest : Proportion of voters

Null Hypothesis\, __H__  __0__ : __p__  __0__ > 0\.6

Alternate Hypothesis\, __H__  __a__ : __p__  __0__ <= 0\.6

__Cut\-off value for Z\-statistic__

Test statistic __0\.638__ > cut\-off value __1\.645__

Hence\, at \.05 significance level\, we _fail to reject the claim_ that the proportion of voters is above 60% this year
